\section{Two-way automata}  

The transition function in the automaton tells us how it behaves for a single input letter. We now extend this function to input strings. This is done by induction on the length of the input string. Suppose that we have two input strings, to which we have associated two partial functions 

Suppose now that we want to convert this automaton into a single- ..


Consider the function 
\begin{align*}
(Q+Q) \to (Q + Q) + Q + 1.
\end{align*}
We now want to iter
