\section{Traced categories and two-way automata}
\label{sec:two-way-automata}

(todo complete this section)
In this section, we show that the single-use category is traced, which enables us to use it to model deterministic two-way automata. Consider a deterministic two-way automaton with states $Q$. The behavior of this automaton over some input word $w$ can be described by a partial  function of type 
\begin{align*}
Q + Q \to Q + Q + 1.
\end{align*}

Suppose now that we want to convert this automaton into a single- ..


Consider the function 
\begin{align*}
(Q+Q) \to (Q + Q) + Q + 1.
\end{align*}
We now want to iter
